North Carolina Public Birth Data
Practice with Multiple Linear Regression 
In 2004, the state of North Carolina released to the public a large data set containing information on births recorded in this state. This data set has been of interest to medical researchers who are studying the relation between habits and practices of expectant mothers and the birth of their children. We will work with a sample of observations from this data set. These cases were chosen at random.
